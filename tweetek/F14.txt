you are a national hero! good playing... but of course the dissapointment cannot be spared... too bad it's just not ment to be. i love going to ann's church. ok the truth is i love going to church. but i hate those depressing times.
i'm so excited i'll be going to ann's church tomorrow for nusery duty. i hope that i won't make any of them cry. haha meiyi's going as well but she won't be joining us for nursery duty. ann says she hates children but hey, that's what we all started as isn't it? hmm and i am going to get my "new" bag tomorrow as well....haha at 30 dollars. regina thinks that i should have gotten myself a new bag since it's 30 dollars. thought about it thought she was right but who cares? what matters is that i like the bag and that it really is still quite new isn't it?       yeah the kids will inspire me to be more loving. kindness can be developed. that's what i believe...
i'm back to spill my guts out... didn't do it just now then i got bottled up and became so irritated over dinner. hate it when i am like that. was kind of fuming just now, then ann let me look at this photo album the stuffs really great but all sold out. too bad then. still hoping to get a new guitar. and i am in desprate need of a new back.... backpack to be specific...my other one is like wasted....just like me.
