After being sick off and on for about a month, I was itching to get out and play. I'm still on the mend, but I took advantage of the relatively clear night and perfect spring temperatures to go down to the pier in Old Town Alexandria and do a little  urlLink busking .  It was like a street fair down there tonight. I claimed a little "territory" and set up, and I found myself surrounded by a string trio, a man making balloon animals, a guy playing music on the rims of glasses of water, and a group showing off a bunch of fancy parrots and other birds. As always, there were many families and couples and a good number of people out on the pier with books and cameras and newspapers.  I met a little girl, about nine years old, who came up to me and said, "If I had a dollar, I would give it to you."  I met a boy of about eleven who said to me, "How long have you been playing guitar? I really want to play guitar." I asked him if he played any other instruments, and he said, "I used to play trombone." His little sister chimed in saying, "The reason he quit trombone was because he kept forgetting to bring it to band practice, and the band director said he had to be more responsible or quit.
