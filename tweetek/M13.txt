The excitement has been growing these past few weeks and I can hardly believe that it is already time to go.  There have been so many last minute details to takie care of that these past few days have felt a little hectic.  But by God's grace and the help of friends and family, things have fallen into place.  Now that my thoughts are no longer focused on the details here, they have turned to India and to Calcutta and to all that will happen there.  I am filled with anticipation for what God will do through us and for us during our time in India and I am thankful to have the support of friends and family back home and here in Omaha.  Let the adventure begin!
Dear friends and family,    After being here for one month, I've learned that living in Calcutta requires many things.  First you need athleticism and agility to make it across the street.  You also need long arms and a good sense of balance to remain standing on somewhat turbulent bus rides.  You also must have rather good lung capacity to avoid suffocation on those rather packed subway rides.  And one must have fearlessness for riding in auto-rickshaws.
