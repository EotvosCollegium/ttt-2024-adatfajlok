okay, so....The dance thing was very entertaining.  They did a great job!  im sure they will all place for nationals..no doubt.  But anywho, the sleepover at Anna's was interesting and fun at the same time.  Anthony and Sam came over to hango out with us untill about 11.  Me, Sam, Kash, and dibble just hung out under anna's staircase where she has that little "Secret Room"  Its soo cozy and fun....well it was fun until SOMEONE WANTED THE LIGHTS COMPLETELY OFF.  Hmm...WONDER WHO.  Anyways.  Once TONY and sam Left.
