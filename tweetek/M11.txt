As you all know, my birthday was on Friday.  I got about $170 total, so I bought a PS2 last night.  I can't wait to get games such as DDRMAX, DDRMAX2, and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, and a memory card!
Yay!  Today is my birthday!  *sings* Happy birthday to me!  Happy Birthday to me!  Happy Birthday dear Anthony!  Happy birthday to me!  We graduate on Tuesday and I'm getting a computer!  I'm soooo happy.  Last night was the awards assembly!  I stood so many times!  It's cool being valedictorian!  Gotta go, Degrassi's on!
Yes, I'm in GCT right now, and it sucks.  We have to finish this stupid powerpoint for graduation and Amanda is getting all pissy.  Eddie denies that he likes Alex.
Graduation is fun but tough.  Today we practiced for the big night!  This one teacher gets really pissed if something's not perfect.  She yelled a lot.  I want to know what's jammed up her ass.  On top of this, I have to write a speech since I'm valedictorian.  I got a paragraph done, and I must say, I like it.  See you tomorrow.
Today was, how should I say, boring.  I hate Sundays!  The only thing I like about them is the sale papers in the newspapers.  We finally went to the mall and I played DDR.
