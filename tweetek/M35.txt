Hi, my name's Steve and I've just entered the world of blogdom. But like a child, cluelessly born into the big wide world, this blog-birth was not a matter of choice. So thank you to Brother Andrew (a monk I once met in Devon) for setting this up and forcing it upon me without my realising, I'm sure it will provide me with many hours of fun. Even if nobody else finds it quite so entertaining.  All I can say is watch this space...theres gonna be some changes around here.  PS. If you want to see Brother Andrew's own personal blog, go to  urlLink andyandshona.blogs.com

Recently Sven's men have made watching a Tim Henman Wimbledon match seem like a stroll in the park, and rollercoaster rides such as the France and Croatia games have certainly added a grey hair or two to my head. Fortunately wins against Switzerland and Croatia have seen Becks & Co through the group stage, largely thanks to the formidable form of Master/Sir/King(delete as appropriate)Rooney.
