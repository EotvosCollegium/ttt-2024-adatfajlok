Well, this was bound to happen, but so far no pregnancy. I can feel my cycle approaching and although it's very early in our adventure, I feel somewhat disappointed. I also feel silly since it would really be a stroke of luck if we got pregnant this early into the game, but I still feel some disappointment.  I've also learned that two of my friends are pregnant, two whom I'd least suspect. I'm envious of them, but very happy. I can't wait to chat with them about babies. I've been buying needlework patterns to stitch for when my baby comes. Some of them are just gorgeous, while others cute. I guess in a way, the time that I'm not pregnant, gives me more time to prepare. Still I'm impatient and have been the type of person who would  in anticipation for a birthday get sick to her stomach, so I'll have to see how I do with this baby thing. Afterall, being sick to one's stomach in this case might be a good sign!
After a very long weekend, I have finally found some time to post. I had a friend over who's daughter was in a serious car accident a few years ago, leaving her with serious brain injuries.
