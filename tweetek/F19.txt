Ok, so I went and saw Spiderman 2, last night at midnight.  (And no I am not an idiot).  It was good; in fact better than the first one, which I think is a rare occurrence.  Believe it or not, it actually has more plot that the basic superhero good vs. evil theme.  Anyway, I would recommend it, however not at midnight.  Going to see a movie at midnight makes you feel old.  I used to be able to stay out until 3 and be at work at 7, but this morning was not easy.  This has led me to believe that I am not capable of getting by on about 3 hours of sleep.  Which means I am getting old.  This stinks.
Well, I read Jenn's every so often and decided that this might be fun.
