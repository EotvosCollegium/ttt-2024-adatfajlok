So here I am in San Jose at a tech forum which is cool. I have xanga but I've never used this and thought I would try it.
So I leave tomorrow, awesomeness. As for then I will not touch my normal xanga, I will write here. I lost it, a stupid piece of paper with my name and picture on it and you would have thought it was the end of the world if you were here yesterday. For the second day in a row I felt physically ill even though I knew I was fine, I thought I was going to throw up (the other day being 2 days ago after being asked about boys twice, I hate that my grandma's friends not knowing, but I dont know if she would be mad if she told. It becomes too much sometimes though, always lying through my teeth...it sucks) and I just laid on the floor trying to keep myself calm. I honestly don't know where it went...that is what bothers me so much. I didn't know it was gone but they keep saying I do. I'm sorry but some piece of paper wasn't on my mind. If it was in my room (which I honestly, whole heartedly, would tell Oniichan to her face (and I would never lie to her) don't think it was) it probably got lost in the big cleanup.
