Blog shmog. Everyone has their collective panties in a bunch about the whole "Blogging" phenom. Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I suppose folks, and by folks I mean hipsters, techie freaks and music nerds, are thrilled that there is an open forum/market for them to express their wisdom, expertise and otherwise verbally stroke each other on a daily basis regardless of geographical location.     Hmm where does that put me? Well I am not going to lie. I am a music nerd and to some extent (regretfully)  a fringe hipster of sorts.
