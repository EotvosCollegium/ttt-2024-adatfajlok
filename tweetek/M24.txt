I am so tired. Yesterday, I worked from 6-1:30ish, and today I worked from 6-1:00ish. My legs are really soar, I can hardly walk.. I just woke up from a nap. He gave me $100 today and said he'd give me the rest tomorrow, which I work from 7-??. Tomorrow should be easy tho, only a couple of hours, sanding the walls of the rooms. Anyway, I'm bored someone take me out.
I just want to thank Kim for helping me out with my Blog. :-)

(audio file removed for archiving purposes)  There's no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going There's no knowing where we're rowing Or which way the river's flowing Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing? Not a speck of light is showing So the danger must be growing Are the fires of hell a-glowing? Is the grisly reaper mowing? Yes, the danger must be growing For the rowers keep on rowing And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowing. .....stop the boat....
So yesterday I went over Jessica's house. We played cards, and I won because everyone else got disqualified, because I said so. :-) After Jessica's house, I went to a cemetery with Kris and Sam, we are trying to break the curse we have. Sam has some pictures, I'll post some here later. Today, I had no work which is good, so I think I'm going to do nothing all day and play games.
