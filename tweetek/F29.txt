Today was our last Memorial day parade.  **tears**  Thank goodness that it is over.  I am so happy.  I know that I messed up quite a few times but oh well i smiled as much as i could.  i can't believe that i am a senior in marching band and almost a senior in high school g2g luv ya all specially  nate ~Jen
Not sure what to say about today, its had its ups and downs.  Shrek 2 was an amazing movie.  Did you know Greg R. has a part?!  And they show a pink thong, i have to say that that part was my favorites.  anyways, yeah the storm tonight kinda freaked me out considering i was home alone with my brother.  In that dreamy state right now which prohibits me from doing anything.  thinking about lots of things but one person in particular.  yes nathan.  we had such a good time on friday.  it was so much fun.  great song is playing right now.
