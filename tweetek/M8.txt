So I returned from Japan on June 20 after spending 2 weeks over ther learning about my company.  Talk about a new experience...  First, I went with a guy who speaks some limited Japanese - he live there for 6 months and was given immersion lession every day.  Thanks to him, I wasn't completely on my own.  But even when you are over there with one person who speaks english, you start to speak in simple sentences.  So Drew and I were dropping words evne when talking to each other.  Being over there was great.  The food was completely different from over here.  Breakfast looked like most other meals to them: some sort of sushi or fish, miso soup, an egg (not like american egg, they have fluffy layered sweet eggs at most meals), rice, and a pickle salad.  Lunch was whatever you wanted: Ramen, Soba, Okonomiaki (shredded cabbage, meat, sweet sauce, spicy mayo fried like a pancake on a griddle - delicious), Curry (they have CoCo Ichiban like we have IHOP), or any number of small resturaunts.  You pick what you want to eat by walking around and looking at the display cases in front of each restuaunt.
