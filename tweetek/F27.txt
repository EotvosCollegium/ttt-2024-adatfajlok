Ummm....okay?
The party went well, except for the fact that only 1 of my friends showed up. This was one hell of a depressing slap in the face. I realized not only that some friendship I thought would survive anything, were merely friendships of convenience and proximity. Also I realized that a lot of my friends aren't doing too well. I seem to be in the best circumstances of any of them.  When a few friends replied to my invitation with "I cannot afford to take saturday night off," I thought that they were being responsible. It has dawned on me recently that they were in a dire situation and could not possibly financially afford the $3 in train fare and roughly $10 in cab fare to come and visit me. I was talking to Chad a while back and he was describing how much he hates all 3 of his jobs and is still only scraping the bottom of the barrel. I feel like a terrible asshole when he asks how my job is going and I respond, "Great! I love it AND I'm rolling in dough." I don't want to rub my success in other people's faces.   I have had this conversation with a few other reasonably successful people and they claim that my friends are merely losers that cannot possibly succeed if they haven't done so by now.
