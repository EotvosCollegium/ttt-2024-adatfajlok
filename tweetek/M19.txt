In the wake of Joel Quile's  urlLink Post  on music, I began to think about the kind of music I like in general.  There are a lot of bands that I am proud that I like.  I am proud that I listen to Pillar, Sonicflood (the old lineup), Jennifer Knapp, Audio Adrenaline, and the Supertones (I actually am beginning to  love  SKA Punk).  I am even proud to listen to the Grateful Dead (I'll share my views on my first Dead show soon), Jimmy Buffett, and the Black Crowes.    I find that when you ask people what they listen to, the most common response is "everything".  So I ask you, Mr. Everything Listener, is that really true?  Do you listen to  everything ?  You do?  You routinely listen to classical?
