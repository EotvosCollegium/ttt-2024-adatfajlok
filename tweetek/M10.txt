Ahh, I finaly had the time to reformat my laptop.  It has needed it for about the last 6 months.  I'm just finishing installing drivers, then I can work on the look and feel of the web site!
So we stroll into the country bar Saturday night.   It was a regular meat market!  So we get some drinks and situate ourselves over looking the dance floor.  We started watching the people on the dance floor. For some reason, all the drunks and newbie dancers were clustering right in front of where we were sitting.  Oh, my goodness; it was a laugh riot!  There was this huge guy that was so drunk, he was  urlLink "River Dancing"  and I think we even caught him moon dancing!  After a couple of drinks, everybody got the urge to dance.  Being the single guy, they send me out first.  So I start looking around the dance floor and saw the one person in the entire bar that wasn't dressed country style.  She was in green shorts, a red top and converse low tops.  I noticed she had been on the dance floor a lot during the night, sometimes dancing be herself or with old men.  I figured she was a dance instructor, my friends didn't.
