exama are not cool. in actuality, it is a measure of how well the teacher hasd taught, and not the student.  so if i get a bad grade, really its the teachers fault. ha.  haha. i win!!! five exams are killer.    i went to a homeschool picnic yesterday.umm what? you're asking? i know sarah's mom works at a homeschool school (i know it defeats the purpose) and she signed me up to go. sarah and i stayed about twenty minutes. i had better things to do.  color coding my laundry came to mind.  My life is your entertainment.(i hope its good)
i have realized that i only blog when i am sad. huh. maybe its beacuse i need to vent. its odd. i am going to the lake again on friday. and then i have exams! i love exams and i hate exams. you know? i really have nothing to say. so i'll stream of CON--SCIENCE.  my nails are growing back out. i will probaly get the redone this weekend.
