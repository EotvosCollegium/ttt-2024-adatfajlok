In 1990 my maternal grandfather passed and 5 years later my maternal grandmother.  They had 8 children, 5 of which still survive.  My own mother passed December 29, 2001 at the age of 72.5 years to the day.  Finding her body was the most shocking, confusing, frightening and ultimately the saddest thing I have ever experienced.  It's an experience that has affected me in ways so profound I will save them perhaps for a later publishing.  Grandma and Grandpa spent MANY years gather information about our family tree.  My mother gladly inherited the task with great zeal.  After my grandparents passings, my extended family had begun to drift apart as I suppose most familys do every few generations.  My older sister who does not have children and I with one teenage daughter are my mothers only current desendants.  After her passing, I inherited the dozens of 3-ring binders compiled over the years about our ancestors.  My home is small with little storage and as I am currently on disability with some time on my hands I decided to retype and/or scan in all the information and burn it to disks for safe keeping in a firebox in case my house burns down or is blown away by a tornado.
