Now I don't think I have ever called him Chewy to his face. In fact I am not sure I remember how he got that name....something about back hair?  My friend Brian Jeanseau is the monthly Blog Star. I will be highlighting a new person in my life each month that inspires me, encourages me, or makes me laugh. This month's BS does all three.      Let's start with why Brian inspires me...  Brian is one of the most real people I have ever met. He is honest, forthright, and nice when doing it. Brian cares for his family. I think that is fantastic. He provides for his family, financially and I know he takes his wife on dates. I have observed him being an excellent husband and father.  Brian is encouraging. He recently took over as worship leader for our church and is doing a phenomenal job. I felt SO cared about the first week after worship he sent all of us an email informing us of how proud he was.
