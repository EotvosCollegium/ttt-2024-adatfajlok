I'm off today!!
Having fun making comments on icered.com .
It started to rain at 12.15pm!!
My face's bloated again..       Drank too much green tea (3 mugs) last night before I go to bed.  I'm now suffering the effects, everything gotta "shift into place" whenever I move my head abit.  Look like bread soaked in water now...      Ben said I'm an air head.. guess it's more of water head now.. more substance.. Muahahahahah...     Don't really feel like attending to any members in such a state.  I feel as if I'm partially in dreamland.  It takes a moment to understand what someone is trying to say!  Wish I can just pop back home and tuck myself into the nice warm bed.
