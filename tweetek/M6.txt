[A little recap of my weekend holiday on the Sunshine Coast.]  With the falling through of my weekend camping plans, a quick audible left me heading out from work early to make my way to Vancouver with the eventual destination of Gibsons.  As the temperature was pushing 30 degree the bus ride to Swartz Bay proved to be less than comfortable.  For some reason  though I am sure there is a good reason  the air conditioning was only put on every 20 minutes and for no more than a minute or two.  What is more ridiculous  that the bus is apparently designed (or policy dictates) that the air conditioning can not be left on or that the bus has air conditioning?  It is a pampered lifestyle indeed when one can only find the lack of continuous air conditioning to complain about.  As usual, the ferry sailing over was gorgeous as the scenery is hard to match.  I spent the entirety of the trip lounging in the sun, soaking in the sights and reading.  Finished Animal Farm by George Orwell (highly recommended) and started Gullivers Travels by Jonathan Swift (a classic that has failed to capture my interest so far).
