Why can't we all close our eyes and go back into yesterday..."The way things were"? When there was more happiness with new friendships, new careers, new classes, new assingment, when it was just all new.  Why does time wither at our heart and souls?             I've come to realize that what may come our way that God will intervene when we become stretched  in our emotions. God won't give you what you can't handle.       You may feel pushed to the ground and you may have been swallowed up by a hole     but you will come up clawing your way out reaching for the light. That light maybe an angel, it maybe your enemy in black thoughts, and your best friend in white light.             We all have our angel's to cheer us on and to pick us up. They are there to fall back upon and to collapse into utterly deep exhaustion. They are sent from God to help us. They come in so many forms. Your partner, cat, dog, brother sister, mother, father, grandparents.
