"Senator Brownback's indecency bill that just passed the senate would be able to fine Howard Stern up to $500,000 per offense. So Howard read how other government fines stack up to the indecency fine. Here they are:   - Bribing an FDA agent to get your drug approved - $250,000 fine   - Transporting contaminated food interstate - $50,000 fine   - Transferring money for terrorists - $11,000 fine   So it seems the government has their priorities straight.

The real President, that is... President Bill Clinton. I'll be leaving the office in about 20 minutes to walk a couple blocks away and meet him. He's having a book signing for his new book and when I bought a copy last week I also got a ticket so I could attend the book signing. He's not my hero or anything, but he was about as real of a politician as we've seen in a while and I am a fan.  Plus, while I have had a couple of celebrity "brushes" in my life with some pretty big names, this will be my first time where I'll have the chance to speak to one.
So, I'm working on my current script, tentatively entitled "Stockholm Syndrome"...
