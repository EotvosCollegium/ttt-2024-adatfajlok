I'll start off this blog with a brief story about the events that occurred last Monday. Perhaps it was a bit of alcoholism carried-over for the weekend. Or maybe it was the sheer realization of how bad our lives really sucked when we arrived in the office on Monday. It could have been because we both got no ass over the weekend. Whatever the reason, it seemed like a terrific idea that Adam and me go out and get completely shit-housed after work Monday night.  One of Adam's friends met us over at our place and, after having a few beers, decided to head to one of our favorite Denver bars, the Falling Rock. The Falling Rock is amazing. This place has close to 200 beers... on tap. Unfortunately, girls do not find this nearly as cool as we do. The three of us double the population of the bar when we walk in; this includes bar employees.
