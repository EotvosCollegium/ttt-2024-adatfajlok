This sux, I'm at  work and there's not much to do. I'm getting cramps sitting in this fkn chair all day long. Bah.  Some New Years resolutions for 2004. Hrm.       Think about New Years resolutions     Think about making New Years resolutions     Think twice about those resolutions     Defer making any resolutions till the next NYE    That sounds alright.
We all know that anyone, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever can find that there is No Evidence to support Anything. Data, thusly, is meaningless. Only the latest "There is no Evidence" is the real truth, and how much they were paid to make their claims.  Bottom Line: Money Talks, Truth Walks.  So, dear readers, remember always that there is no evidence until it happens to you, but by then you will have become a statistic, your data is thus meaningless, and you are thereby forgotten.
