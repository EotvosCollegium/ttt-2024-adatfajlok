I've decided to begin keeping this blog, kind of as a personal Journal. Life, i'm learning, is all about moments in time...what you do, what goes on around you, mistakes made, and lessons learned as a result of those mistakes. So many times we look back on the past, and try and remember those lost moments; what we were feeling at a particular moment in time, what was the logic/our train of thought at that particular time...so that's pretty much the purpose of this blog.        In any case, this has been a pretty interesting week. Certain things I was sure about regarding who I am, and what I want for my future, were tested...and I learned more about myself. I entered some unchartered territory in regards to my love life. The guy I'm dating, Tony, opened my eyes to some truths about myself that I previously was unaware of. What were those truths? Well, I'm pretty hard to date...that much I knew, LOL, but the reasons were pretty eye opening.  Granted, he didn't come out and say these things the way I'm about to post them...these are just conclusions I came to based on our discussion.
