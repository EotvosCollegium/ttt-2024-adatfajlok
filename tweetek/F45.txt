SCROLL DOWN IF ANYONE FROM CAMP IS READING!  So let's move on to somehting happier, because drama should not be my only choice of journal entry. Work was fab today. Libby was working and she is a blast to work w/ and she is so damn fast at everything! Tomorrow I am going shopping and I cannot wait to buy some jewelry, I am such a girly girl sometimes, but hey, after shopping, I am going hiking and fishing and that isn't always girly. It's odd how much I have changed. Okay It is shout out time, I am going to start this fabolous post w/ my camp friends. I recentely went to U of O and had a fabolous time  learning debate and such and making friends. I admit I had my points where I simply wanted to go home, see my friends and give everyone the finger, but hey I survived right? We in the girl's dorn had our moments, Nicki spazzing over losing a debate, me spazzing at Kels for calling me a slacker, Kels spazzing at me for me telling her that question asking incesscintely in a public debate is bad, all of us spazzing before round. Basically we had our tifs, but we all loved each other immensely, we were like a sorority and the wrestlers ( SIGH) our fraternity.
