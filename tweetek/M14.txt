I was stuck in traffic this morning on the way home from dropping my wife off at work.  While sitting there, staring at the drivers in the other cars, I got to thinking about the premise of a traffic jam.  Basically what jams traffic is some guy stopped at the front of an ever-growing qeue of cars.  Who is this guy?  What made him decide to set up camp in the middle of a highway?  I can understand when there is construction, but what about when there is absolutely no reason to be stopped.  What makes this person do it?  I've decided now that I want to be a traffic jammer.  My mission is now to be the cause of the gridlock on the highway.  But how to do it?
