Welcome to the repository of all information about Rykert and Libby's November wedding...  Stay tuned for more information.
Last night Rykert and I went to see Fairenheit 9/11.  Rykert thought is was really good, and I thought it was alright.  But apparently it's been getting all sorts of mixed reviews...  Such as: An article by Christopher Hitchens  urlLink here .  And a somewhat surprising review by Fox News  urlLink here .  But hey, even Martha Stewart showed up.
Today, when I should have been studying for the bar exam, I gave myself a quick crash course in HTML.  The result is that I can now post things in the sidebar and link to other sites.  I'm still learning, but I've made magnificent progress (if I do say so myself...)
This is a baby sweater knitted for a friend.  It was supposed to be a 6-month size, but is more like newborn.  Which means, that it won't be given as a gift.  I guess next time I should check the gauge.  urlLink     urlLink
My first Bottoms Up Bucket O' Chic hat.  This is in Berrocco Cotton Twist, and is pretty much too small for me.  And it seems to blend in with my carpet.  urlLink     urlLink
My new blog.  Now let's see if I have a clue what I am doing...
I'm off to take the bar exam.  I'm incredibly antsy, and unable to study anymore (even though I don't feel like I know anything at this point.)  ...because being able to pick the correct answer to a completely unrealistic and tricky set of facts is clearly what being a lawyer is all about.
