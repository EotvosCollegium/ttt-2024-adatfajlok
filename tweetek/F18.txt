Artist:Avril Lavigne                         My Happy Ending          So much for my happy ending      oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh      Oh oh, oh oh, oh...      Let's talk this over           It's not like we're dead           Was it something I did?           Was it something You said?           Don't leave me hanging           In a city so dead     Held up so high          On such a breakable thread     You were all the things I thought I knew           And I thought we could be CHORUS          You were everything, everything that I wanted           We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it           All of the memories, so close to me, just fade away           All this time you were pretending           So much for my happy ending           oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh      Oh oh, oh oh  You've got your dumb friends       I know what they say           They tell you I'm difficult           But so are they           But they don't know me           Do they even know you?
