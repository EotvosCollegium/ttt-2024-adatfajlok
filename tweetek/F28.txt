Say, if youve never gone to Stop and Shop and bought food for the apartment but still manage to come home everyday and make yourself lunch and dinner, wouldn't you say to yourself, "hmmm...wonder where all this food came from?"  Or maybe when you saw the 12 page receipt that I posted on the front of the refrigerator so you would know where all the food came from, you would see it and say, "wow, my roommates spent a lot of money on food, maybe I should chip in."  Or maybe, just maybe, when you saw that I took it upon myself to write my name on everything I purchased so you would know who paid for it and who it belonged to, you would think, "maybe I shouldn't eat this because it doesn't have my name on it and my mother taught me when I was 5 not to touch things that have other people's names on them.
