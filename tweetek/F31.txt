I love to eat, as obviously seen in my body.  I also love trying out new restaurants.  One of my goals is to try out all the restaurants in Greenbelt 2 and 3 before, if ever, theyll close down.  Another dream is to be a food/ restaurant critic in magazines or newspapers.  But I doubt that it can happen since I am not a professional writer and writing is one of my waterloos.  Thats why I had been thankful with blog somehow, at least I can express my thoughts and practice being a critic.  Hehe.  Anyway, last Saturday was the graduation of my brother, Eric, from Grade7.  And just as any family after graduation, we dined out.  My dad suggested that we should eat in Greenbelt since Ill be coming from Makati, and maybe hes thinking that in this way hell not spend much.  But me and my siblings goal is to squeeze to the last centavo all the money of my dad.  So, my sister suggested Nuvo, a fine dining restaurant in Greenbelt2.  The place is known for its being a fine dining restaurant.  Of course, we tried what could be the most expensive meal.  Some food fancy me, however, it seems like the resto is fond of goose liver so much, that almost every meal has goose liver for its sidings.
