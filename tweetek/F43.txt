my apologies for the lack in posting lately. My wonderful Dell laptop finally shit. Well, not really, it is just in the shop having the keyboard replaced due to a mishap with a couple of Kendall's last summer: 1. A glass of Kendall Jackson spilled all over the keyboard, and 2. Kendall the dog pissing all over the computer while I was packing for Cali. (I guess I should have taken that as a sign.) Anyway, the keyboard is finally being replaced a year later. you should have seen the dude's face when I told him all that it had been through. later he called me and told me my computer had contracted 4 viruses. that ho. so in the meantime, i am internet-less. which hasn't been that bad. is it me, or is the world of blogging not what it used to be. it used to be fun, and now people are dropping like flies and shit. i don't know. maybe they have all gone on and gotten lives and i am just one sick, sad, sorry, unemployed fuck.  well my gainfully unemployed ass is going to go soak up what is left of the sun. peace.
"Yes, you see love is not something that happens to you, it is something you do. So what didn't I do?" ~Bridget Jones, The Edge of Reason  As much as I would love to love someone, I feel I am thoroughly incapable of it right now. I am inventing my own little world, getting into the groove of the single thing.
