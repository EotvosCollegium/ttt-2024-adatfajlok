welpz.. my life until now.. imma write it here so i wont forget.. everyone says to just  'let it go... forget about it' .. well, i will let it go.. but i'll never forget. i dont mean it in a way that imma b angry, sad or upset about the whole thing 4ever. i'll let it go in a sense that, when i think about it all again, i wont feel the same anger as i do now... but the  whole  thing, the whole 5-6 months blessed me with so many precious memories i could never 4get. they were very special moments, i dont think i was ever as happy as i was wen everything was still cool bak then.. but thinking about those happier times still brings tears and makes my throat feel all funny... wat do u expect... i was  in love .. and i kno... everyone tells me.. your first is the hardest 2 get over. im not saying that im still hooked on the guy....  NO WAY IN HELL . ive moved on since then.. hehehe.. tell ya later =P  newaiiz.
