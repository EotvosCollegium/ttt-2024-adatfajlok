These pics are from a bike ride to the north of Yonezawa. I was guided around by Andrew (a 2nd year ALT also stationed in Yonezawa), and we spent most of the time following the main river out of the city. I spent much more time biking than taking photos, so there isn't much to show unfortunately. Should be exciting for river fetishists though.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
Here are a couple of shots from a Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Yonezawa. Apologies for the blurriness of the bottom-right photo (up until this point, I hadn't been using the focus properly on the digital camera). Idiot proof? Not bloody likely.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
These photos were taken during my commute to Yonezawa, from Tokyo.
