Band was a complete disaster. Chris Schilling calls and quites. WTF?! I am not trying to be atheist b/c I am not. I go to church. He said he quite b/c God was telling him band was getting in the way. First off, we don't practice that much and it's for only 2 1/2 more months. NOT BIG DEAL! Anyways, Pat (our drill writer) forgot to write me in the drill. So now I am marching in Chris's spot. Big Problem! One saxaphone marching w/ a bunch of brass members. lol Oh well I guess.     So guess who I like? Well you all heard me talking about Josh. I met Josh @ the Abbey when I went w/ Jeremy like a week ago. Jeremy calls me last night and tells me he is going to a party @ David's. After getting in this big argument w/ my parents (what's new) I convinced my mom to let me go stay the night w/ Jeremy.
