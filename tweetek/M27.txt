Southampton 0 - 0  Blackburn After poor performance by both team in the first match, it is unlikely that will be any winner in this game.     Birmingham 1 - 2  Chelsea Chelsea would be a favourite to win the match, but the former Chelsea boys in Birmingham might just be worth a goal.    Charlton 1 - 0 Portsmouth Charlton will be fired up to bounce back from their loss to Bolton, making it a tough game for Portsmouth.      Crystal Palace 1 - 2  Everton Palace might hoped Everton bad form will continued to snatch the 3 points. However Moyes and his boys will not be pushovers and might find their scoring touches.      Fulham 2 - 3  Bolton  An interesting match that could see a goal spree if the strikers strike early. Bolton will look to build on their weekend success but Fulham at home will be difficult to shake off.     Liverpool 2 - 0 Man City  At Anfield, Liverpool look too strong for the Man City on paper.
