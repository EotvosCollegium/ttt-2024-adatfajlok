Me and some Friends Burned our school books yesterday, including  school uniform which we strug from a tree and set fire to the bottom. Because it was nylon it had little fireballs burning off it. Twas fun... This was followed by a game of Dangerous Frizbee, this involved throwing a metal tray across the garden at each other. I suffered a head shot, that hurt bu otherwise it was fuuuunnnnn. This was then finnished with shooting a 'Imitation fish"(A stuffed toy lobster), with a crossbow. And throwing knives at a remaining school book the refused to burn...  DAMN IT!!
