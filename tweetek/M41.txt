Stopped taking the attack dose of Piracetam today - as it was weirding me out a little bit. Everything was moving way to fast, and I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night.  Went out for dinner with Anneliese and noticed that the focus combined with alcohol brought out a lot of the old irritability in me (or maybe that's just her :p).  So we're now on the following leading up to exams:  2.4g of piracetam (800mg x 3 per day) 4.5mg hydergine (2.25mg x 2 per day) 500mg of centrophenoxine (250mg x 2 per day) 15mg vinpocetine (10mg morning, 5mg evening)  The effects I have noticed so far: * increased ability to recall * increased ability to visualise * am feeling much more introspective * have some strange uber-focus * colours seem more vivid, especially at night * lack of tiredness  Let's see how it goes!
Now this is intriguing.  I seem to have acquiring myself a girl/friend?  There's a couple perculiar things about this one.  A. She's older than me. B. She's a photographer. C. She's like... arts :)  Well it's also odd because it's the first damn girl that I've met in such a long time who is actually interesting to talk to.  I've been wandering around in a daze, like I was 16 again, with this damn fool grin on my face..   Churning through the SMSes and phone time like there's no tomorrow, and even did the old "no you hang up first" thing last night - albeit partly a joke..   Well it's fun anyway.  ...and in work news.  Offered a permenant PM role at GE.
