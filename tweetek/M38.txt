I come to realise something. It takes every lesson you've learned and turns it on its head. "Respect the lives of others." "Treat people as you yourself would like to be treated." Sometimes we close our eyes and just listen to the echoes of our hearts. We all fall in love and there are times when we love so much that we lose ourselves in our emotions. More often than not, we wonder why there are love that grows, and love that grows cold. We would start to search for answers and try to find where love has gone wrong. But in the end, we find ourselves where we started for we cannot question love when it has its own reasons. Love will always be as it always has been....silent, mysterious and deeply profound. Many of us believe that love is forever, that love never dies, only to be disillusioned in the end when we find our hands empty and our hearts longing.
