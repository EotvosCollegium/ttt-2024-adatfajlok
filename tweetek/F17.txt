which is today, I thought I'd share a page from our past.  Karen and I met at Clemson during a research summer through the Governor's School of Math and Science after our junior year in high school.  She actually wanted to be a scientist.  I, on the other hand, was smarting after being unfairly waitlisted by the drama department at the Governor's School of the Arts, which was only a summer program at that time.  But  that's a story for another blogpost. At any rate, she was mercilessly torturing and killing bugs in the name of scientific progress, as I recall, and I was counting bubbles.
