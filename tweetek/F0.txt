I think I have finally found an anime convention near where I live. Here's the info:  Saturday & Sunday July 31st - August 1st  The first Sacramento Anime/Manga show will be held at the Sunrise Mall. Admission is free. Events will include an Anime room, artists alley, art contest as well as a large selection of vendors. More information will be available soon.   ~~~~*  I am also focusing more on my empathic powers. No I am NOT a crazy person. If you know me look up Empaths. If not...Ignore this.  ~~~~*  The 4th of July is coming up and I think my Aunt and Uncle will be visiting too. They have more anime then anyone I know!~ ^_^  ~~~~*  MUST LIVE THROUGH SUMMER!
