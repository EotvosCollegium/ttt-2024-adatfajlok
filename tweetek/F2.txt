One day, I'm going to become selfish. I'm only going to think of myself and only think my own feelings.  One Day, I'm going to take the whole weekend and do whatever I want, whenever I want.  One Day I'm going to spend money and buy myself stuff like there's an endless supply of m0ney.  One Day, I'm going to drive off in my car to some unknown destination and not come back until I feel like it.  One Day, I'm going to read books, crochette, embroider, sew non-stop until I can't stand it any more.  One Day, I'm going to disappear from my job with out notice, resignation or anything and disappear into the world, traveling aimlessly from one country to the other.  One Day, is not today. One Day, is not tomorrow. One Day, will not be next week, and One Day, probably will not even been next year or the next decade.  However, it is Today. Just like Today was yesterday; Just like Today will be tomorrow. I am too unselfish to think of anybody other than those that I love. Too loyal to leave anybody behind. Too loving to abandon those that depend on me. Too kind to hurt anyone intentionally.  One Day, though, all of this Today, will not matter.
Sometimes, I feel very obsolete and other times I just think the world has gone a little bit crazy.  Where has gone:   Respect for other people's property/land.
