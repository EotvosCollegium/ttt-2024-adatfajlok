So, I've been saying ever since I got home yesterday how much I have to do in order to be ready to go to EFY in the morning.  It's already 9, and I still have another load of laundry to do, totally pack all my stuff, completely clean my room and my bathroom (neither of which are very pretty right now..)  And yet, here I am writing in my blog.     Anyway, I got home from camp yesterday--  all in all, it was a really great week... I'd say probably my best out of the 4 times I've gone.  The only part that wasn't so cool were these stupid pranks that the 1st years tried to play... they were so stupid, and people really got sensitive...    I don't know, girls can be really stupid sometimes.  It was the first year that it worked out that Katie could go with me, and we just had a blast.  Our tent was awesome, we laughed ALL the time, and just had fun being retarded.  And it also turned out to be incredibly spiritual... getting me in the mood for EFY.  I'm so excited about going tomorrow.  I just love being able to hang out and have fun with people you know have the same standards you have... and no one cares if you're stupid like I am, you're just able to have fun.   Anyway, I know this is a short entry, maybe I'll write more about camp later.  I hope everyone is having a great Sabbath.   Love ya'll                                                           Megs.                                                  SOME INSIDE JOKES OF THE WEEK FOR ALL WHO CARE AND WHO WERE THERE--        "Let it BURN!
