I started working on my latest project today. It's a German Film Parade. We have a bunch of German's in town to shoot a season's worth of shows for  urlLink ProSieben TV . So today we scouted locations. Those few words hold a tremendous amount of meaning. Call it elliptical editing of the pen. What it means is that we spent 12 hours running around  urlLink Disney  parks looking at locations that we plan on shooting during the upcoming five weeks. Yep. We are scouting five weeks of locations in the space of two days. If that sounds like a lot, it's because it is. A hell of a lot. But it's what we have to do to get the job done. It does give me the chance to practice some german. More to come...
I've been thinking about this, and I've decided we need to ban political advertisement for Presidential candidates.
