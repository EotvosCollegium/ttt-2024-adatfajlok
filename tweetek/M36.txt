Yea i dont think things are ever gunna be the same. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!  I'm such a fucking ass hole.  If i woulda kept my mouth shut or at least been pesimistic.  what the hell made me optimistic on that day of all days. i mean it never works out so why even hope.  This is prolly just me overreacting once again.  Im such a bastard.
Im afraid thing not not ever be the same between us. I dunno, it just feels kinda akward. I really hope thing work out but whatever. Just a fucking loser that screws everything up. Every so often i feel like killing myself again. You may be asking yourself "Again?" Yup, I have attemped suicide. I would tell u the story of what happened but its crap and completely not worth my or your time. Oh man I tell ya im such a fucking spaz. I over react with little stuff and then my over reaction makes other peeps feel bad then i feel bad cuz i made them and its a never ending cycle. Yea im just an all around bad person: Im cynical, pesimistic, boring, ugly and fat. And why the hell would anyone want to even talk to me?!?!?!? Im such a fucking bastard. AARRRRRGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well i started this new blog to just clear my mind, let it all hang out and if ppl see it whatever its all good but i'll just asume that no one is seeing this.
Ok, so today was fun, I woke up, watched ping pong on the olympics, then around three I had to go to my trumpet lesson.
