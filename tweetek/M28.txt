God damn these worthless humanoid scum! They feel as if they own everything, as if they're perfect. They think like they're God himself! And they even gang up on Sakura... Getting little Ryuzuki here mad as hell, and I don't want to see what happens to those guys if ever Ryuzuki meets them... Bloody... It's going to be too bloody for my tastes... Poor guys... Hope you had a happy life messing up someone else's! Cause your puny pathetic excuse for a life is going down the drain I like to call Ryuzuki's anger... Sure, he can take his anger and shut it in a very big room, leaving him sane for about two years.
