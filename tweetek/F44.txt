We used to talk   We used to laugh   We were best of friends   I thought thats how it would always be   You taught me so much   Told me exactly what to say   I wish it were still the same   But someday I know it will   Maybe not today   But well meet up again   It wont be long until I see your face   Above the stars one day        RIP my Darling :(
He's an incredibly understanding guy!       I'd had a long-standing appointment with him a couple of months ago to touch up my current tatts and discuss the designs for a couple of other planned ones, which I failed to attend due to being unable to go out, even across the road, so he called me up to re-arrange it, but due to his popularity and busy schedule it couldn't be arranged for several weeks.        Well, today was the day, and as usual I'd forgotten all about it! Well, John called me first thing this morning and left a message to remind me that my appt was at 11am, first appt of the day.
