I don't know. Ever since the Tofino trip.... I've been laughing at everything. And I mean everything. I might still be stoned, I'm really not sure.   Last night was good. I could've gone to Jen Senini's party thing, but I kinda didn't feel up for it. One, I'm PMSing, and Two, Kendall had just came back and I didn't feel like ditching and pissing anyone off. So it was me, Kendall and her Vancouver friend Katie and we had a movie fest. Alex&Emma, Along Came Polly, Butterfly Effect and That dumb LIndsay Lohan movie. It was fun though, and then Bron showed up and that was good times too.
