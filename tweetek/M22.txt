Back in 1986, while working for GE up in Utica, NY, I was on my way to a class outside of Washington, DC.   On the plane, I sat next to a nice girl named Sean, about my age, and very attractive.   As it turns out, she grew up not far from me, and had recently graduated law school.   We had a pleasant flight and it seemed like both of us hit it off.  After the plane landed, we said our good-byes, and I went to retrieve my luggage and head for the rental counter.  That's where the trouble began.   As this was my first solo business trip, I had never rented a car before.   To no surprise, they asked me for my driver's license.   I pulled out my wallet but my license was not there.   Did I put it in my pocket?   (This was long before 9/11, so you didn't need I.D. to get on the plane).   I thought back to the past few days to see if I could remember the last time I'd seen my license.
