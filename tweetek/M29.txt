Good Evening,  Tonight I, Sandy Mackay, present you with my review of the movie "Troy".  Now although this movie received high ratings as well as two thumbs up, I have a different opinion.  Ladies and Gentleman I present to you, TROY vs. THE MAN WITH NO NAME TRILOGY.  Stars: Troy Starred:  Achillies - Brad Pitt  Paris - Orlando "Lando" Bloom  Hector - Eric Bana  Agamemndon - Brian Cox  Helen of Troy - Diane Kruger  Menelaus - Brendan Gleeson  Old Spartan Fisherman - Manuel Cauchi  Brad Pitt's Ass - Orlando "Lando" Bloom   The Man With No Name Trilogy Starred:  Clint Eastwood - The Man With No Name (occasionally referred to as Joe)  Mexicans - Mexicans  Enough said.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Writing:  Troy:  David Benioff ripped the plot of Troy from Homer's "The Iliad".  I have read this epic poem and believe that the movie hardly does it justice.  The Man With No Name Trilogy:  A completely original idea, complete with Mexicans, guns, dames and, of course, Clint Eastwood.  You will notice that during the movie Clint E. does not talk much, as he lets his pistol talk for him.  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Acting:  Troy: As cardboard as a board made out of cards.  Man With No Name Trilogy: Clint Eastwood, need I say more?  Point, Man With No Name Trilogy.   Length:  Troy:  approximately 2 hours and forty-five minutes.  Man With No Name Trilogy: Three Movies which can be watched at your leisure.
